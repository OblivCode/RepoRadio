# 🎵 Background Music Folder

This folder contains background music tracks for RepoRadio podcasts.

## Usage

RepoRadio will automatically select a random track from this folder to use as background music during podcast generation.

## Supported Formats

- `.mp3`
- `.wav`
- `.ogg`

## Track Requirements

- **Duration:** Recommended 2-5 minutes (will loop automatically for longer episodes)
- **Genre:** Lo-fi beats, ambient, chill electronic, tech news background music
- **Volume:** Will be reduced by 20dB automatically, so use normal mastering levels

## Example Tracks to Add

1. `lofi_beats_1.mp3` - For deep technical discussions
2. `tech_news_energy.mp3` - For high-energy Hype Man episodes
3. `ambient_code.mp3` - For detailed code analysis segments

## How It Works

When background music is enabled:
1. A random track is selected from this folder
2. Volume is reduced by 20dB so dialogue remains clear
3. Track loops seamlessly if dialogue is longer than the music
4. Fade-out is applied at the end for polish
